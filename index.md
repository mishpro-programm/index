## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mishpro-programm/index/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing.


function Obj(speed, hearts, onTap){
  this.speed = speed;
  this.hearts = hearts;
  this.onTap = onTap();
  this.x = 0;
  this.y = 0;
  this.z = 0;
}
var DinoTRex = new Obj(1, 5, function(){DinoTRex.y += 3});
document.write(DinoTRex.hearts);


For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mishpro-programm/index/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
